  `As shown in [ARTICLE HERE] this region is already the home of many sites that are significant to the Gamilaroi people. Santos has not even considered trying to identify them, even though they are aware that many of them are undiscovered. Instead, in this report [ARTICLE HERE] Santos has shown that they are willing to destroy these sites without consideration as acceptable collateral damage. It is part of a trend of extraction companies to destroy sacred Aboriginal sites without consultation or care, continuing destruction that already occurred in Western Australia (e.g. ARTICLE HERE).`,

  `Santos has not gotten the permission of the local Aboriginal groups that have ties to the area in order to start their planning. Elders such as [Uncle A], [Auntie B], and [Uncle C] have voiced their opposition to the project here. Rather than consulting with our First Nations folks, Santos has deemed it too hard to preserve their sacred sites and has opted to look for the sites only after they've committed to destroying this land as shown here [ARTICLE HERE].`,

  `Only one extraction project has significantly changed extraction plans upon finding Aboriginal sacred sites. Out of [HOW MANY SITES]. Santos already knows there are a significant, unknown number of sites in Northwest New South Wales, and they plan to look for sites after their plan has been approved by the IPC [ARTICLE HERE]. Given the poor track record of extraction companies to save sacred sites, it is highly unlikely that these sites and the local Gamilaroi people's connection to the land will be respected and preserved; rather, it will be treated as collateral damage in order for Santos to continue extraction.`,
